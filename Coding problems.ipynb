    "Here are some interesting programming problems that I have collected during my 3 months of learning programming, mainly from the online platform Codeforces, covering various topics such as graphs, number theory, constructive problems, and more. Some problems I have solved on my own, while others I have referenced solutions from multiple sources and explained them in my own understanding. I hope that through these problems, you will learn something useful."

    "Robocon arena is a square grid with dimensions NxN. Each cell of the grid contains a certain number of gifts. The time it takes to move between two adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) is T units. Initially, the Robot is positioned at the starting point (1,1) and needs to move to the destination position (N,N). The rule set by the organizers is that every time the robot takes 3 steps, it must pause at its current position to collect all the available gift boxes (including the case when the current position is the destination cell). It takes 1 unit of time to collect each gift box. Your task is to devise an optimal strategy for the robot's movements to reach the destination as quickly as possible. Some cells may contain a large number of gift boxes, so you should avoid stopping at these cells unless necessary, as it would consume more time.\n",

    "We can immediately recognize that this is a problem related to finding the shortest path in a graph, where the graph is an NxN square grid and each cell is connected to its adjacent cells on the grid. The fact that the cells do not have weights makes us think of applying Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the problem. However, the issue here is that the robot can collect gifts whenever it takes 3 steps, and the value of the gifts is determined by the cells. Therefore, we need to address two main questions: \n",

To reduce computations, k can be reduced to 0, 1, 2 (the remainders when dividing by 3 to minimize the number of cases). \n",

    "* To ensure the correctness of the Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to iterate over ALL cells in the graph. Then, at each update of the value d[i][j][k], this guarantees that the Dijkstra's algorithm still works correctly because we are comparing with ALL cells in the graph, and *each* iteration will find a fixed label. By doing so, we continue until the end of the loop."

Due to the palindromic property, we have a[x_1] = a_(n+1) = a[x_2]. Without loss of generality, assume x_1 < x_2. Let u be the midpoint index of the substring [x_1....(n+1)]. Then, if we take the mirror image of the substring [x_2....(n+1)] across u, we obtain a substring that lies within the range from 1 to n and satisfies the palindromic property. This means that [x_2....(n+1)] has appeared before, leading to a contradiction. This is an important observation and serves as a premise for constructing the subsequent solution.\n",

    "* For the second question, we first notice that for n = 3, p(n) = 3 in all cases. Therefore, x_1 >= c_1. Now, the key to constructing a satisfying substring is to control how p(n) changes each time we add a character (whether it remains the same or increases by 1). To achieve this, the best approach is to make all c_1 characters the same (corresponding to p(c_1) = c_1) and ensure that there are no additional unique palindromic substrings afterwards. However, this is not possible (since no matter what the next character is, it will always increase p(n) by 1). \n",

This repetition will ensure that p(n) remains the same. From there, we can easily determine the construction method for the general case."

    "The main question of this problem is: How should we divide it to ensure an infinite process? It is easy to see that in order to achieve that, n must be divisible by the number of left choice options. On the other hand, we have an important observation that we can always arrange it so that after each iteration, the number of left options decreases by exactly 1 unit (distributing m-1 options evenly with [n/(m-1)]+1 votes for 1 option with the remaining votes). Therefore, we need to check if the smallest prime divisor of n is not greater than m!"
